# limited-sniper-extension
instructions: 
1. replace the config.json file from the sniper with the one found in the extension and fill in what needs to be filled.
2. (this is very important) you have to input your discord id in the "authorized" list otherwise you won't be able to use the bot lol, e.g.
    ```json
        "authorized": [23423423432432432],
    ```
3. place the extension.py file in the same directory your main.py file is located, run it, and yippeeeee
